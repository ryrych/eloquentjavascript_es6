# Eloquent JavaScript Examples With Tests

My *TDD* attempt to do exercises from [Eloquent JavaScript](from http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

## Why?

- Didn't create project with automated *asset pipeline* before (only ready setup—Ember.js)
- Running code snippets in the [Eloquent JavaScript sandbox](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) was a chore
- Just for fun
- For [Coder Dojo sessions in Bielsko-Biala, Poland](https://www.facebook.com/events/1018846984802426/)

Enjoy!
